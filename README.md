# pointerstructure [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/mitchellh/pointerstructure?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/mitchellh/pointerstructure)

pointerstructure is a Go library for identifying a specific value within
any Go structure using a string syntax.

pointerstructure is based on
[JSON Pointer (RFC 6901)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901), but
reimplemented for Go.

The goal of pointerstructure is to provide a single, well-known format
for addressing a specific value. This can be useful for user provided
input on structures, diffs of structures, etc.

## Features
